    <p class="text-xl font-semibold pb-4">Overview</p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      This project focuses on implementing techniques for geometric modeling to
      support a rudimentary mesh viewing and editing application, starting with
      Bezier curves and surfaces and eventually moving on to more complex mesh
      operations such as edge flipping and subdivision to improve mesh
      resolution. We work with algorithms such as the de Casteljau algorithm for
      Bezier curve interpolation as well as geometric algorithms for modifying
      edges and vertices in order to implement loop subdivision.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold pb-4">Task 1: de Castaeljau's Algorithm</p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      De Casteljau's algorithm is a simple interpolation algorithm that, given a
      set of control points and an interpolation parameter t, recursively
      interpolates between neighboring control points until we're left with a
      single control point, the actual point on the Bezier curve corresponding
      to t. In our implementation, we implemented it recursively using the
      vector data structure to store our intermediate interpolated points
      (calculated as <i>t * first_point + (1 - t) * second_point</i>) at each
      level, returning the single point in the vector when the algorithm is
      finished.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      Below, we show the steps to find a point at t = 0.5 with a custom curve we
      defined as well as another point on a slightly modified curve at a smaller
      t-value.

      Task 2: Extending de Casteljau to Bezier Surfaces
    </p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      De Casteljau's algorithm doesn't just apply to Bezier curves! Given an M x
      N set of control points and two interpolation parameters u and v, we can
      interpolate a point on the Bezier surface formed by the control points
      using the same 1-D de Casteljau algorithm with slight modifications. Here
      instead of putting all the control points in, we treat each row of control
      points as its own Bezier curve and use the 1-D algorithm to find the
      interpolated point at u on each curve. We then interpolate to find the
      point at v on the new curve formed by the u-interpolated points to find
      the actual point at (u, v) on the Bezier surface!
    </p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      To implement this in code, we re-used some of the code from the previous
      part and modified it to return a Vector3D instead of Vector2D. Again, we
      used a vector to store the intermediate 1-D u-interpolated points obtained
      from each vector in the vector of control point vectors and ran the 1-D
      routine again on those points to get the final point at (u, v).

      Task 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals
    </p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      To implement the vertex normals, for each half edge bordering the vertex,
      we iterate through the neighboring half edges for that face to find each
      vertex making up the triangle. We then calculated the normal for that face
      by taking the cross product of the vectors from the original vertex to
      each of the other vertices. By repeatedly iterating through the half
      edge's twin's next half edge, we can repeat this procedure for each face
      bordering the vertex. The final area-weighted vertex normal is then
      obtained by iterating adding up each face normal vector times the vector's
      norm (face area) and then normalizing.

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold pb-4">Task 4: Edge Flipping</p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      Edge flipping involves taking two bordering triangles and changing the
      orientation of the edge connecting them to connect the other two vertices
      instead. To implement this we manually grabbed references to every half
      edge, vertex, and face in each triangle by using the edge iterator passed
      in as well as any necessary instance variable and reassigning pointers
      accordingly. To ensure correctness, we used the diagram from lecture and
      drew out all mappings in the geometry from the old triangle to the new
      triangle. We debugged using inspection, but we had lots of confidence in
      our sketches!

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold pb-4">Task 5: Edge Splitting</p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      Edge splitting is similar to edge flipping, but instead of flipping the
      orientation, we add in the new edge on top the old edge, creating a new
      vertex in the middle. This involved significantly more pointer
      reassignments than the previous part since instead of just reassigning
      pointers, we need to do that on top of creating a new vertex, 2 new faces,
      3 new edges, and all associated half edges.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      Thankfully, our approach of implementing it essentially the same way as
      edge flipping (drawing out all mappings from old triangle to new
      triangle(s)) let us finish this task without much need for debugging. What
      made sense for us when implementing the algorithm was also defining all
      the geometry that needed to be created at once, and then performing half
      edge operations one face at a time.

      Task 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling
    </p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      In order to upsample the meshes, we implemented the Loop subdivision
      algorithm. We followed the given procedure without any modifications.
      First we calculated the new positions of each original vertex using the
      Loop subdivision rules, then calculated new positions for all "edge"
      vertices to be inserted during subdivision. To perform the subdivisions,
      we then did splits on all edges and flips on only new edges created when
      splitting by taking a look at the isNew instance variable for all
      geometry, set during the first part of the subdivision or during an edge
      split. Finally we adjust the vertex positions to what we initially
      calculated, completing the process.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      During the implementation/debugging process we didn't run into much
      trouble since we followed the given procedure, but some interesting errors
      we ran into involved vertex positions not being calculated correctly due
      to a typo in the math as well as a typo resulting in using the wrong
      vertices to calculate new positions of "edge" vertices inserted.

    <p class="pb-6">
      Some interesting behaviors we noticed in the cube and other meshes in the
      dae folder were that the mesh often doesn't subdivide symmetrically, as
      vertices with larger degrees tend to change position less than vertices
      with smaller degrees due to the Loop subdivision vertex rules heavily
      reducing the weight of vertices' neighbors in the original vertices' new
      positions as degree increases due to the degree being in the quotient. The
      orientation of edges affects degree and is thus related to how the mesh
      deforms after subdivision as well.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-6">
      We attempted to completely reduce these effects in cube.dae by splitting
      edges to make faces symmetric, but since spliting marks the new edges
      created as new, the new edges resulted in weird deformations as the
      subdivision algorithm attempted to flip them during the 4-1 subdivision
      process. Flipping edges also didn't work since no amount of flipping would
      result in every vertex on the cube having the same degree, so even though
      the resulting geometry changed in a more symmetric way depending on which
      faces we flipped edges on to look the same, it was never fully symmetric.
