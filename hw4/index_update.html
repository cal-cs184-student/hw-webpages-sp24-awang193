      <p>
        In this project we implemented a mass-spring-based model for cloth mesh
        simulation. In each of the parts of the project, we implemented the
        actual mass-spring mesh construction, physics simulation, collision
        handling, and various shaders to change the appearance of the cloth and
        other meshes. Some of the biggest takeaways from this project were
        understanding the physics behind the mass-spring model and why each of
        the constraints are placed in addition to familiarizing ourselves with
        GLSL and how mesh textures are shaded and rendered in real software.

    </a>

    <p>
      To simulate our cloth, we first need to build a mesh that can be used in
      the simulation. Our cloth is represented as a grid of evenly spaced point
      masses that span the dimensions of the cloth with springs connecting each
      point mass to simulate the physical constraints of real cloth. Structural
      and shearing constraint springs connect axis-aligned and diagonal
      neighboring point masses, respectively, to simulate the actual structure
      of the cloth and bending constraints while bending constraint springs
      connect axis-aligned point masses 2 away to simulate bending over the
      point mass in between. The bending constraints are made weaker (0.2 ks) in
      order to represent the fact that structural and shearing constraints
      contribute more to the shape of the mesh.

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The spring constant affects how taut the springs connecting each point
      mass are, so changing it affects how the cloth behaves during simulation.
      In <i>pinned4.json</i>, increasing ks made the end state more taut / rest
      higher than the default and also decreased the amount of rippling and
      bounce during simulation. Decreasing ks had the opposite effect, with a
      lower resting point and more rippling and bouncing especially towards the
      center of the cloth.

        <small> What about for <code>density</code>? </small>
      </b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Density changes how massive the point masses are, so changing it will
      affect how much the springs are able to lock the cloth in place.
      Increasing the density makes each of the point masses heavier, so the
      cloth sags lower, falls faster, and is more prone to rippling and bouncing
      effects when falling. Decreasing it has the opposite effect since the
      springs become that much stronger relative to the weight of the point
      masses, so there is less bouncing and the resting point is higher. In
      short, it has almost opposite effects as changing spring strength.

      </b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The damping term represents loss of energy through heat loss, friction,
      and other external forces not explicitly simulated. High damping leads to
      slower position adjustments due to a smaller position delta during Verlet
      integration and a "smoother" fall into the resting position. Lower damping
      leads to faster position adjustments and a more unstable cloth with lots
      of rippling and bouncing before settling into the resting state. Unlike
      spring strength and density, however, changing damping does not affect the
      final state, only how quickly and stably the cloth gets there.

      <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
    </a>

    <p>
      In this part of the project we implemented collisions with two types of
      objects: spheres and planes. Collision handling is done on a
      per-point-mass basis, and each type of object has its own intersection
      test.
    </p>
    <p>
      For spheres, we check if the point is less than or equal to
      <i>radius</i> distance away from the sphere's origin, and if so, we find
      the vector between the point mass' current position and the tangent point
      (direction of origin towards point mass scaled by radius) and add that to
      the point mass' current position to correct it towards the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      For planes, we follow a similar approach. First we check if the point
      mass' current position is on the opposite side of its position one time
      step ago by taking the dot product of the point mass' positions at the
      current and last timestep with the plane's normal vector and checking that
      the signs are different. If so, we draw a vector to the tangent point
      again, this time by scaling the normal vector of the plane by the current
      vector's position dot the normal, and add it to the current position to
      correct it back to the plane's surface. The final step is adding a small
      offset times the plane's normal to prevent the point mass from getting
      stuck in the plane or falling through on the next timestep.

    <p>
      The ks affects how rigid the cloth is. Increasing it from the default of
      5000 N/m causes the cloth to fold less and it doesn't bend to fit the
      shape of the sphere as much. In contrast, decreasing it causes the cloth
      to have even more folds than the default case and it wraps around the
      sphere very closely.

    <p>
      Similar to what we observed in part 2, when density is lowered, the cloth
      becomes lighter and exhibits less bending as it falls down. This causes
      the cloth to fold more regularly, possibly since the reduced mass of each
      point mass means that crumpling from gravity happens more slowly, so the
      impact of the random perturbations in the surface of the cloth could be
      reduced compared to the default. Increasing density has the opposite
      effect, causing the cloth to fall faster and crumple more violently and
      irregularly. Lowering spring force has the opposite effect -- the weakened
      constraints result in the cloth folding very irregularly with a lot of
      crumpling since the springs can't hold the shape of the cloth as well, and
      increasing spring force causes the opposite to happen.

      </b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is a program that runs in parallel with other shaders on
      the GPU instead of the CPU. Shaders can perform different parts of the
      rendering pipeline, with vertex shaders used to change the positions of
      vertices on a mesh passed in early in the pipeline to fragment shaders
      that take in vertices, normals, and other information to calculate
      fragment/pixel colors after rasterization. Together, vertex and fragment
      shaders allow us to not only to map varied textures and surfaces onto a
      mesh, but also add different lighting and shading effects for
      photorealism.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <b>
        Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a
        screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient
        component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen
        shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire
        Blinn-Phong model.
      </b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model combines three types of lighting to simulate
      shading under more photorealistic lighting conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambient component consists of some constant ambient illuminance scaled
      by a coefficient (the ambient light in the world not dependent on
      direction).
    </p>
    <p>
      The diffuse component is the same as the diffuse shader -- it depends on
      the illuminance of the object + distance to the viewer (inverse square
      law) and the direction of the object's surface normal. The two are dotted
      together, so if the angle between the light source and the normal is
      small, most of the light is scattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, there's a specular component. Normally, Phong shading doesn't
      account for light that is greater than 90 degrees from the viewer, but the
      Blinn-Phong model uses a halfway vector between the viewer vector and the
      light vector and takes the dot product of that with the normal instead in
      order to solve this. The halfway vector represents how closely aligned the
      view direction is with the angle of reflection (it'll be exactly the
      normal vector at the precise angle of reflection!), and best of all, it
      will never be more than 90 degrees away from the normal vector in most
      cases unless the light source is very far underneath the surface. Finally,
      we exponentiate the dot product to increase "shininess" of the specular
      component before multiplying it by ($I/r^2$).

    <p>
      Bump mapping involves adjusting the normals of the surface in order to
      simulate the bumps/"depth" on the texture. Combining this with Phong
      shading, we can get textures that have somewhat photorealistic depth even
      without adjusting the positions of the vertices! Displacement mapping
      combines bump mapping with a vertex shader that actually displaces each
      vertex's position in the direction of its normal scaled by the height of
      the vertex's position in the texture. This results in a texture that not
      only looks like it has more depth, but actually changes the vertex
      positions to match!
    </p>
    <p>
      For displacement mapping, making the mesh less coarse allows for finer
      detail in vertex and normal adjustments, so the resulting mesh follows the
      actual "bumpiness" of the texture much better since the texture is sampled
      at more locations. For example, the displacement mapping example on the
      left has the actual shape of the bricks while on the right the bumps don't
      actually follow the shape of the bricks very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For bump mapping, making the mesh less coarse doesn't affect the clarity
      of the texture too much.
